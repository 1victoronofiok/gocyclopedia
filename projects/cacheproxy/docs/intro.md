# Proxy

a proxy is like a server that hides actual server and forwards external requests to the actual server

right?

Yes, that's the basic idea! A proxy acts as an intermediary between a client and the actual server. It can serve different purposes depending on how it's used:

1. **Forward Proxy** ‚Äì Used by clients to access external servers. It hides the client's identity from the server.  
   - Example: A VPN or web proxy that hides your IP address.  

2. **Reverse Proxy** ‚Äì Sits in front of backend servers and forwards client requests to them. It hides the actual server from clients.  
   - Example: Nginx or HAProxy used for load balancing, caching, and security.

Are you looking to implement a proxy in Go, or just trying to understand it conceptually?

Your storage design for the cache proxy is solid in terms of maintaining a **synchronized in-memory map** alongside the **cache storage**. Here's a quick evaluation:

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
1. **Fast Reads** ‚Äì Since reads are directly from the in-memory map, lookups are very fast.
2. **Sync on Startup** ‚Äì Ensuring the map is populated from the cache at startup prevents cold starts.
3. **Write-Through Strategy** ‚Äì Every write operation updates both the cache and the in-memory map, reducing inconsistency.
4. **Minimizes Cache Misses** ‚Äì Reads never touch the underlying storage/cache directly, improving performance.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issues**
1. **Data Consistency Issues**  
   - If a write operation fails on the cache but succeeds in the map (or vice versa), they may go out of sync.  
   - Solution: Implement **atomic operations** or a rollback mechanism.

2. **Concurrency Handling**  
   - If multiple goroutines modify the map simultaneously, you might face race conditions.  
   - Solution: Use `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, or `sync.Map`.

3. **Cache Eviction Strategy**  
   - If the cache has an eviction policy (e.g., LRU), but the map doesn‚Äôt, stale data might persist.  
   - Solution: Implement a mechanism to track evictions and sync accordingly.

4. **Memory Usage**  
   - Keeping all data in memory means high RAM consumption for large datasets.  
   - Solution: Implement a **TTL-based cleanup** or a **size limit** for the in-memory map.

### üî• **Possible Enhancements**
- **Background Syncing** ‚Äì Periodically check if the cache and map are in sync.
- **Logging & Metrics** ‚Äì Track read/write failures for debugging.
- **Distributed Cache Handling** ‚Äì If you expand to a distributed system, consider cache invalidation strategies.

Overall, your approach is efficient for a local cache proxy, but handling **failures, concurrency, and eviction policies** will be key to making it reliable. üöÄ
